# Introduction-of-Kalman

Welcome to the Object Tracking with Kalman Filter project! This MATLAB repository provides an implementation of the Kalman Filter for object tracking. The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements, making it a powerful tool for tracking moving objects in various applications.
